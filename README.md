# 🚆 Railway Data Engineering & Analytics

An end-to-end **Data Engineering & Analytics project** developed as part of a **Data Engineering Internship at Cognifyz Technologies**.  
This project focuses on analyzing railway operational data to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights using Python.

It demonstrates data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and business-oriented reporting.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Railway Data Engineering & Analytics** project processes railway schedule data to understand:
- Day-wise train operations
- High-traffic source and destination stations
- Weekday vs weekend operational patterns
- Frequently used train routes
- Operational concentration across major hubs

The project follows a structured **data engineering workflow** aligned with real-world industry practices and produces insights useful for operational planning and decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To perform structured data engineering and analytical operations on railway schedule data by:
- Loading and preprocessing raw CSV data
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Creating meaningful visualizations
- Extracting insights and business recommendations
- Presenting results in a professional project report

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Friday records the highest number of train operations, indicating peak demand
- Weekday operations dominate over weekends
- A limited number of stations act as major operational hubs
- Certain routes show consistently high frequency, indicating strong demand
- Weekend services present opportunities for expansion

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Increase train frequency on high-demand routes during peak days
- Optimize schedules on low-traffic days such as Mondays
- Expand weekend services for tourist and leisure travel
- Allocate additional resources to high-traffic hub stations
- Utilize mid-week stability for maintenance and optimization
